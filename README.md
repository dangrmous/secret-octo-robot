Beerify was the group capstone project for my Full Stack JavaScript class at Portland Code School. It is Backbone.js based web application that uses Node.js and Express for web services, and Orchestrate for data peristence. It was created by myself, Esha Peddireddy, and Danielle Witt.

Beerify acts as a crowd-sourced, single-point data source for what beers are on tap in Portland at what bars.
